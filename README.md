# AutoHotKey
These are my AutoHotKey (.AHK) scrips. Like the one that 'fixes' old games arrow control, the script will swap ASDW and the Arrow keys if the game is open



See the files for more information (or poke me) but here is a nice overview:
# files
### Anti unhuman left/right click
Disable to fast clicks (need to be 1ms apart) for broken mousses

### Audio Change
Will change the audio device then the button is pressed, So you can switch easily between headset and speaker and such

### AutoHotKey
This is my Big always running script.
This will change hotkeys when you are in old games (It swaps ASDW and ARROW keys, so you can play more comfortable)
But this also adds functionality extra mouse buttons in some games
